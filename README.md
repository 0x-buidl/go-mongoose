# Go Mongoose driver

A mongoose like go mongodb driver.

## Motivation behind

- Had to migrate a robust nodejs server with mongodb to a go server.
- Couldn't find a mongoose-like package for go that does what mongoose do.
- Decided to write my own go-mongoose driver that serves my personal needs and will probably make it more robust as time goes on.

## TODO

Still lots to integrate, just keeping a short list i can remember here.

- Run hooks for all READ / WRITE operations.
- Add standard documentation & usage docs.
- Add Schema validations.
